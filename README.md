This was my first attempt at making a game. I tried adding some music and score board. For the next version i tried to better the round system and what the game does when the player hast lost. This first version is still playable.


Issues:
need to fix when player hits ghost 
game looks very bland and cramped 
graphics are poor 
audio is trash 

Updates For Future:

better pngs for ghosts 
better music 
add level system
fix ghost player interaction
better ghost hunting model, not use random function
